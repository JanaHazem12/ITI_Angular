<div id="BioDiv">
    <h3 id="bioPar">I graduated from the International School of Elite Education with a 98.5% in the IGCSE system and 
        earned a bachelor's degree in Digital Media Engineering and Technology from GUC, graduating in June 2024.
        I interned at GASCO (summer 2022), gaining insight into their SCADA system, 
        and at El-Sewedy Electric Cable Accessories (Julyâ€“September 2023), where I developed 
        a PowerApps application for reporting and assessments, integrated with SharePoint and Dynamics 365. 
        I also automated email reminders, implemented GS1 standards for asset management, and created interactive 
        dashboards using Power BI.
